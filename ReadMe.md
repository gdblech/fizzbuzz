# Enterprise FizzBuzz!
Welocme to Enterprise FizzBuzz, this project is not just a simple implementation of FizzBuzz.

## FizzBuzz but different!
Normal FizzBuzz implementations focus on doing the process as efficiently as possible, not this implementation though!

Instead of using boring old if statements or a switch expression, this project does exactly that but takes it a step
 further with a Rest interface that does all the normal FizzBuzz work!
 
 This Project was built using Spring Boot as learning project to learn implementing a REST interface using Spring.
